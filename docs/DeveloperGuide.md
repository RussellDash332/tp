### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F09-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F09-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete-s id/A0123456X`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F09-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F09-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F09-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F09-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `FypManagerParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddStudentCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a student).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete-s id/A0123456X")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete-s id/A0123456X` Command](images/DeleteStudentSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteStudentCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `FypManagerParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddStudentCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddStudentCommand`) which the `FypManagerParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddStudentCommandParser`, `DeleteStudentCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F09-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the FYP manager data i.e., all `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStudentList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `FypManager`, which `Student` references. This allows `FypManager` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Student` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F09-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both FYP manager data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `FypManagerStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `jeryl.fyp.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedFypManager`. It extends `FypManager` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `fypManagerStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedFypManager#commit()` — Saves the current FYP manager state in its history.
* `VersionedFypManager#undo()` — Restores the previous FYP manager state from its history.
* `VersionedFypManager#redo()` — Restores a previously undone FYP manager state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitFypManager()`, `Model#undoFypManager()` and `Model#redoFypManager()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedFypManager` will be initialized with the initial FYP manager state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single FYP manager state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th student in the FYP manager. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitFypManager()`, causing the modified state of the FYP manager after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `fypManagerStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted FYP manager state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new student. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitFypManager()`, causing another modified FYP manager state to be saved into the `fypManagerStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitFypManager()`, so the FYP manager state will not be saved into the `fypManagerStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the student was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoFypManager()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous FYP manager state, and restores the FYP manager to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial FypManager state, then there are no previous FypManager states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoFypManager()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoFypManager()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the FYP manager to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `fypManagerStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest FYP manager state, then there are no undone FypManager states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoFypManager()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the FYP manager, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitFypManager()`, `Model#undoFypManager()` or `Model#redoFypManager()`. Thus, the `fypManagerStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitFypManager()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `fypManagerStateList`, all FYP manager states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire FYP manager.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the student being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
