**JerylFypManager** is a desktop application catered to professors and final year project (FYP) students to manage and track the progress for students’ FYP projects, as well as serving as a platform for professors to provide feedback on their students’ progress. The application’s simple design provides a nifty platform to navigate through and present the FYP projects in a concise manner.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `JerylFypManager.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F09-1/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your FypManager.

1. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`list`** - lists all FYP projects the professor is supervising

   * **`add A0123456G n/Automation of Selenium`** - adds the FYP project of the student with ID A0123456G titled _Automation of Selenium_

   * **`delete A0123456G`** - deletes the FYP project of the student with ID A0123456G

   * **`mark A0123456G IP`** - marks the FYP project of the student with ID A0123456G as _In Progress_

   * find machine - searches any FYP project names that has “machine” in its name, for example it will output the FYP project with “Machine Learning” in its name

   * **`help add`** - shows a message on how to use the `add` command

   * **`help`** - shows the list of all commands available

   * **`exit`** - exits the application

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/FYP_NAME`, `FYP_NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Neural Network`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/FYP_NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Neural Network t/SOC` or as `n/Data Caching`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/SOC`, `t/SOC t/ML` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/FYP_NAME t/TAG`, `t/TAG n/FYP_NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list` and `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `list 456`, it will be interpreted as `list`.

</div>

### Adding students FYP: `add`

Adds a new FYP of a student to the FYP manager.

Format: `add STUDENT_ID n/FYP_NAME e/EMAIL [t/TAG]…​`
* `STUDENT_ID` should be in the following format: "A" + (7 digits) + (1 letter), e.g. `A0123456G`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
A student can have any number of tags (including 0)
</div>

Examples:
* `add A0123456G n/Neural Network e/e0123456@u.nus.edu t/NN`
* `add A0987654X n/Data Caching e/e09876567@u.nus.edu`

### Removing students FYP: `delete`

Removes a FYP from the FYP manager. A FYP could be deleted for the following reasons:
* Student dropped the FYP 
* Student finished the FYP

Format: `delete STUDENT_ID`
* `STUDENT_ID` should be in the following format: "A" + (7 digits) + (1 letter), e.g. `A0123456G`

Example:
* `delete A0123456G`

### Marking project status: `mark`

Marks a FYP as "Done"/"In Progress"/"Yet to Start", etc.

Format: `mark STUDENT_ID STATUS`
* `STUDENT_ID` should be in the following format: "A" + (7 digits) + (1 letter), e.g. `A0123456G`
* Current supported statuses are as follows:
  * **"DONE"** - Done
  * **"IP"** - In Progress
  * **"YTS"** - Yet To Start

Examples:
* `mark A0123456G DONE`
* `mark A0234567H YTS`

### Searching keyword: `find` [pending implementation]

Finds projects whose names contain any of the given keyword(s).

Format: `find KEYWORD/[KEYWORD2/KEYWORD3/…]`
* The keyword is case-insensitive, e.g. `Neural NetWORK` will match `neural network`
* Partial keywords will also be matched, e.g. `Ne` will match `neural network` and `Genetic Algorithm`
* Leading and trailing spaces are ignored, e.g. ` neural network  ` will match `neural network`
* Only project names could be searched
* Projects matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search), e.g. `find neural network/tree` will match both `neural network` and `decision tree`

Examples:
* `find Neural Network`
* `find Neural/Network  /    Data`

### List of commands: `help`

Shows a list of valid commands or a help page on a particular command.

Format: `help [COMMAND]`

Examples:
* `help add` - This shows a detailed help message on the `add` command
* `help` - This shows only the list of commands

### List of FYPs: `list`

Shows a list of final year projects with the student IDs.

Format: `list`

### Exiting the application: `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`
